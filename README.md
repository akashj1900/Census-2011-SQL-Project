# Census-2011-SQL-Project


## Analysis of the Indian Census 2011

In this project, we'll work with data from the https://www.census2011.co.in , a compendium of statistics about all the states in India as of 2011  .

In this project, we'll use SQL in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to explore and analyze data from this database.
Database:

The dataset is quite simple and will not allow us to answer complicated question. There are two tables-

## Dataset1:
* id - id number attributed to every single district of states.

* District- Names of all the districts of the states in the table.

* State-Names of all the states (including Union Territories) in India.

* Growth - ratio of the population growth in census 2011.

* Sex_ratio-Sex ratio (also called gender ratio) is the ratio of male to female count.

* Literacy-Percentage of ratio of literate people by the whole population.

                                   
## Dataset2:

* id - id number attributed to every single district of states.

* District- Names of all the districts of the states in the table.

* State-Names of all the states (including Union Territories) in India.

* Area_km2 - Total area of the specific district in km2.

* population - population of specific district.

                            
Both the dataset contains 640 rows .

## Notes:

The database being very simple, we couldn’t answer complicated questions. This project was intented to practise my SQL skills and show knowledge of simple to advanced SQL skills.
